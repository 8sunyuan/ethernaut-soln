# Ethernaut Solutions

Ethernaut is a set of Solidity based CTF security challenges written by the OpenZeppelin team.

This repo contains my Solutions/smart contracts deployed via Remix IDE.
Some of the challenges such as "Fallout" and "Alien Codex" are no longer exploitable in newer Solidity versions.
